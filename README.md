      ```
      git clone https://github.com/Viraj5903/Property-Rental-Management-ASP.Net-Core-MVC.git
      ```

        "ConnectionStrings": {
        "PropertyRentalManagementDB": "Server=<ServerName>;Initial Catalog=PropertyRentalManagementDB;User=<Username>;Password=<Password>;Integrated Security=False;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
